        <h1>Where We At</h1>
            <p>Where are we right now with the current AI? We've got some places in the world wherewe got self driving cars, and just the thaugh of this is insane but as i said, "some places", so where are we now? There are advanced forms of technology and computers thinking on their own. A simple google search using algorithms to find exactly what you are looking for, a simple conversation with Siri, asking her questons, making her find you recipies for cakes that matches your taste. We are really looking forward to how the world will look in 100 years from now.</p>
