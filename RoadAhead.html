        <h1>Road Ahead</h1>
            <p>Machines are just "getting" smarter and smarter. There is no doubt that where we are headed, is going to change the world as most of uss know it right now. We can expect much automation in the nearest future. Our lives will go faster (more efficient) and we can xpect less tragic accidents. But how will is affect most of our jobs? People who work in offices, secretary, bank empoyees and accountants will be at risk from future mashines replasing them. Is this necessarily bad? Well, some majors and professions might be replaced by mashines, but  when one door closes, another one opens. </p>
