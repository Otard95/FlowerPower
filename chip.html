            <h1>What's a chip?</h1>
            <p>A chip is called an intergrated circuit (IC). Generally, it is a small and thin piece of silicon onto which the transistors making up the microprocessor have been etched. A chip might be as large as an inch on a side and can contain tens of millions of transistors.</p>

            <h1>GPU</h1>
            <p>GPU is an acronym that stands for Graphical Processing Units which are chips that are used in artificial intelligence applications like image recognition and computer vision. The actual way you architect a chip can be optimized for specific artificial intelligence tasks like image recognition, voice recognition, or big data analysis of any kind.</p>

            <h1>Neural networks</h1>
            <p>Software versions of artificial neural networks have been around for a long time. Large ones have recently produced breakthroughs in speech and facial recognition from companies such as Google and Facebook. Physically building a neural network on a chip instead could make this type of information processing more power-efficient and practical.</p>

            <h1>Mobile intelligence</h1>
            <p>Unfortunately, the chips don’t allow for the network to be trained using hardware acceleration just yet. However, with a trained network, its behavior can be executed on a chip. In the future, these chips are able to implement the learning algorithms themselves in hardware, allowing for the creation of true, learning “electronic brains”.</p>

            <h1>Simulations</h1>
            <p>There's a machine that tries to simulate how the brain works. It is the size of a slimmed-down mini-fridge, or a medicine cabinet. It consists of 48 little boxes, each about the size of a computer hard drive. The boxes contain computer chips that are, well, a little weird. IBM calls it “TrueNorth.” It’s a specialized chip designed, from the ground up, to run neural networks.</p>

            <h1>Today's AI</h1>
            <p>Chipmakers designed GPUs to render images for games and other highly graphical applications, but in recent years, companies like Google discovered these chips can also provide an energy-efficient means of juggling the mind-boggling array of calculations required to train a neural network.</p>
