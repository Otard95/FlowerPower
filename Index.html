        <h1>What Is It</h1>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI), is usually defined as the science of making
          computers do things that require intelligence when done by humans.
          The term was first used in 1965 by Stanford researcher John McCarthy.
          Since 1965 the progress has been slow, but for the last years the research and progress has increast.
          There are tw o types of artificial intelligence, General AL and Narrow AL.

          <h1>How it works</h1>
            <p>
              There is no single way in which artificial intelligence works.
              One definition of AI is when a computer can solve a problem that normally requires a level of intelligence.
              Over the past 60 or so years, many different approaches to solving a wide variety of problems have been discovered by AI researchers.
              For example, chess can now be played by computers such as Deep Blue at a Grand Master level.
              It works by examining many thousands of chess board configurations, to see the future result of making particular moves.
              Another example is expert systems, which solve problems in areas such as medicine and engineering by duplicating the problem solving performed by real human experts.
              Other problems are more difficult. For example, making computers read and communicate in English is very challenging, and is far from solved.

            <p>Where are we right now with the current AI? We've got some places in the world wherewe got self driving cars, and just the thaugh of this is insane but as i said, "some places", so where are we now? There are advanced forms of technology and computers thinking on their own. A simple google search using algorithms to find exactly what you are looking for, a simple conversation with Siri, asking her questons, making her find you recipies for cakes that matches your taste. We are really looking forward to how the world will look in 100 years from now.</p>
