            <h1>What's a chip?</h1>
            <p>A chip is called an intergrated circuit (IC). Generally, it is a small and thin piece of silicon onto which the transistors making up the microprocessor have been etched. A chip might be as large as an inch on a side and can contain tens of millions of transistors.</p>

            <h1>GPU</h1>
            <p>Is an acronym that stands for Graphical Processing Units which are chips that are used in artificial intelligence applications like image recognition and computer vision. The actual way you architect a chip can be optimized for specific artificial intelligence tasks like image recognition, voice recognition, or big data analysis of any kind.</p>

            <h1>Neural networks</h1>
            <p>Software versions of artificial neural networks have been around for a long time. Large ones have recently produced breakthroughs in speech and facial recognition from companies such as Google and Facebook. Physically building a neural network on a chip instead could make this type of information processing more power-efficient and practical.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the chips don’t allow for the network to be trained using hardware acceleration just yet. However, with a trained network, its behavior can be executed on a chip. In the future, these chips are able to implement the learning algorithms themselves in hardware, allowing for the creation of true, learning “electronic brains”.</p>

It consists of 48 little boxes, each about the size of a computer hard drive. The boxes contain computer chips that are, well, a little weird. IBM calls it “TrueNorth.” It’s a specialized chip designed, from the ground up, to run neural networks.</p>

        <h1>What Is It</h1>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI), is usually defined as the science of making
          computers do things that require intelligence when done by humans.
          The term was first used in 1965 by Stanford researcher John McCarthy.
          Since 1965 the progress has been slow, but for the last years the research and progress has increast.
          There are two types of artificial intelligence, General AI and Narrow AI.

          <h1>How it works</h1>
            <p>
              There is no single way in which artificial intelligence works.
              One definition of AI is when a computer can solve a problem that normally requires a level of intelligence.
              Over the past 60 or so years, many different approaches to solving a wide variety of problems have been discovered by AI researchers.
              For example, chess can now be played by computers such as Deep Blue at a Grand Master level.
              It works by examining many thousands of chess board configurations, to see the future result of making particular moves.
              Another example is expert systems, which solve problems in areas such as medicine and engineering by duplicating the problem solving performed by real human experts.
              Other problems are more difficult. For example, making computers read and communicate in English is very challenging, and is far from solved.

We've got some places in the world wherewe got self driving cars, and just the thaugh of this is insane but as i said, "some places", so where are we now? There are advanced forms of technology and computers thinking on their own. A simple google search using algorithms to find exactly what you are looking for, a simple conversation with Siri, asking her questons, making her find you recipies for cakes that matches your taste. We are really looking forward to how the world will look in 100 years from now.</p>
